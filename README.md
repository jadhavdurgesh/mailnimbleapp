**MailNimble** is an intelligent email assistant designed to enhance your Gmail experience. Built with a Flutter frontend, Spring Boot backend, and a Chrome extension, it integrates seamlessly with Gmail via the Chrome API. Powered by the Gemini API, MailNimble lets users compose emails with customizable tones (e.g., formal, casual, persuasive) and provides live UI updates for a smooth, cross-platform workflow. This project showcases full-stack development, OAuth authentication, and AI automation, completed between June 2024 and September 2024.

- **Chrome Browser**: For extension testing

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/MailNimble.git
   cd MailNimble
   ```

2. **Backend (Spring Boot)**:
   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     ```
   - Update `application.properties` with your Gemini API key and OAuth credentials:
     ```properties
     gemini.api.key=your-api-key
     spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-id=your-client-id
     spring.security.oauth2.client.registration.google.client-secret=your-client-secret
     ```
   - Build and run:
     ```bash
     ./mvnw spring-boot:run
     ```

3. **Frontend (Flutter)**:
   - Navigate to the frontend folder:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     flutter pub get
     ```
   - Run the app:
     ```bash
     flutter run
     ```

4. **Chrome Extension**:
   - Navigate to the extension folder:
     ```bash
     cd chrome-extension
     ```
   - Load in Chrome:
     - Open Chrome → `chrome://extensions/` → Enable "Developer mode" → Click "Load unpacked" → Select the `chrome-extension` folder.
   - Configure OAuth in `manifest.json` if needed.

5. **Run Together**:
   - Ensure the backend is running (port 8080 by default).
   - Launch the Flutter app and load the Chrome extension.
   - Test with Gmail.

## How It Works

1. **AI Tone Selection**: Open the Chrome extension in Gmail, select a tone (e.g., "Formal"), and let the Gemini API draft your email.
2. **Live Sync**: The Spring Boot backend processes the request and updates the Flutter UI in real-time.
3. **Gmail Integration**: The Chrome extension injects the drafted email into your Gmail compose window.
4. **OAuth Flow**: Securely authenticate with Gmail using Google’s OAuth 2.0.
